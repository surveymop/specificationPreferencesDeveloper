# Understanding Developer Preferences in Analyzing Runtime Specifications
This repository contains the materials, data, and scripts related to the study "Understanding Developer Preferences in Analyzing Runtime Specifications", which investigates how software developers perceive and evaluate different runtime specification languages.

## ðŸ“„ Summary
The study explores developer preferences between two specification languages used in runtime verification:

JavaMOP â€“ a formal, declarative specification language

MSL (Minimal Specification Language) â€“ a lightweight, Java-based annotation language

Through a scenario-based survey involving 78 professional developers, we analyzed perceptions across four key dimensions:

Intuitiveness and Understandability

Writing Efficiency

Perceived Rigor

Syntactic Simplicity

We also correlated these perceptions with objective complexity metrics such as Lines of Code (LOC) and Halstead Effort.

## ðŸ“Š Repository Contents
data/ â€” Anonymized survey responses and processed datasets

scripts/ â€” Python scripts for statistical analysis and chart generation

specifications/ â€” Examples of MSL and JavaMOP specifications used in the study

report/ â€” PDF and LaTeX source of the final paper

figures/ â€” Visualizations and diagrams used in the publication

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
MSL was strongly preferred for intuitiveness and writing efficiency.

JavaMOP was perceived as more rigorous.

Objective metrics confirmed that MSL specifications are shorter and less cognitively demanding.
